This is adapted, as an exerecise in learning Haskell, from an earlier learning project written in Mathematica.
It is my first Haskell program.

### Development status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orome/crypto-enigma.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/orome/crypto-enigma)

I'm currently experimenting with some Haskell language features and can't promise 
[the development version](https://github.com/orome/crypto-enigma/tree/develop) 
will work.
