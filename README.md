An Enigma machine simulator with state and encoding display.

This is adapted, as an exerecise in learning Haskell, from an earlier learning project written in Mathematica.
It is my first Haskell program.

Full [documentation] — for the latest [release version] — is available on Hackage.

### Development status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orome/crypto-enigma.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/orome/crypto-enigma/branches)

I'm currently learning and experimenting with some Haskell language features and can't promise the
[development version] will work on.
